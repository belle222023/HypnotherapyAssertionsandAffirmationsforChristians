          <h3>Inspiration for Writing the Book</h3>
         
          <p>Hypnotherapy is a form of searching and affirmation for Christians. I looked inward and at the world and realized how unprepared I truly was—and how unprepared the world was to be caught up in the clouds of heaven to descend with Jesus Christ and His followers to serve Him during His Millennial Reign on Earth.</p>

    <h3>About</h3>

    <p><strong>What inspired you to write your latest book and what made it unique?</strong>
      I believe that all of us, including myself, have a need to become closer to Deity, and that we need a good Christian book to help us do just that. The uniqueness of this book is that it provides methods to build our spirituality beyond prayer and supplication to our Heavenly Father.

    <p><strong>What themes or messages do you often explore in your work?</strong> 
      That I have created a self-help book which will not only bring readers closer to Deity, but will also help them understand the reasons for the creation of this world and our responsibility to our Creator.

    <p><strong>What inspired you to become a writer?</strong> 
      I examined my spiritual condition and decided to see if I could make a positive difference in my life and in the lives of others as well—all with help from above. I believe the Second Coming is just around the corner, and I am not prepared. Perhaps the world isn’t either—and perhaps I could help in our preparation.
