      <div class="bio-full">
        <h3>What was your inspiration for writing the book?</h3>
        <p>Hypnotherapy is a form of searching and affirmation for Christians. I looked inward and at the world and realized how unprepared I truly was—and how unprepared the world was to be caught up in the clouds of heaven to descend with Jesus Christ and His followers to serve Him during His Millennial Reign on Earth.</p>
      </div>

        <div class="bio-card">
          <h3>What do you want the readers to know about you?</h3>
          <p>I retired from ranching and farming when I was 17 years old. For the next 24 years and 8 months, I served in the United States Army, from the end of World War II through Korea and Vietnam. I finally retired on August 30, 1970. In the years that followed, I attended chiropractic school and then practiced for 37 years, mostly in Trinidad, Colorado. After retiring from practice, I spent most of my time studying the Scriptures and writing spiritually oriented books and booklets.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bio-card">
          <h3>What inspired you to become a writer?</h3>
          <p>I examined my spiritual condition and decided to see if I could make a positive difference in my life and in the lives of others as well—all with help from above. I believe the Second Coming is just around the corner, and I am not prepared. Perhaps the world isn’t either—and perhaps I could help in our preparation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bio-card">
          <h3>How has your personal life or background influenced your books?</h3>
          <p>I was raised by good parents in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, studying the scriptures and living the life they exemplified. I also learned from observing the world what I should and should not do. As I looked around and watched what was considered acceptable among my Army companions, I knew much of it was not acceptable to our Savior. The help I received from above during the wars in which I was involved is the reason I am still alive today—by a great deal of help from above.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bio-card">
          <h3>What authors or books have influenced your writing style the most?</h3>
          <p>The Old and New Testaments, The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ, The Doctrine & Covenants, The Pearl of Great Price, and other books by Latter-day Prophets.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bio-card">
          <h3>What’s a surprising fact about you that readers might not expect?</h3>
          <p>That I love my Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost more than life itself.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bio-card">
          <h3>What themes or messages do you often explore in your work?</h3>
          <p>That I have created a self-help book which will not only bring readers closer to Deity, but will also help them understand the reasons for the creation of this world and our responsibility to our Creator.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bio-card">
          <h3>What inspired you to write your latest book and what made it unique?</h3>
          <p>I believe that all of us, including myself, have a need to become closer to Deity, and that we need a good Christian book to help us do just that. The uniqueness of this book is that it provides methods to build our spirituality beyond prayer and supplication to our Heavenly Father.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bio-card">
          <h3>What do you want your readers to remember about you or your work?</h3>
          <p>We must not read this book just once, but continuously study and practice the assertions and affirmations within it to help us become perfected, as God has commanded us in Matthew 5:48: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." Becoming perfect, as our Heavenly Father is, cannot be accomplished all at once, but is a journey that lasts throughout this life and beyond, one step at a time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bio-card">
          <h3>How do your personal values or beliefs shape the stories you tell?</h3>
          <p>My values and beliefs were instilled by my parents during my upbringing and by staying close to Deity through prayer, supplication, and continuous study of the scriptures. Life is a school teaching spirituality—overcoming, conquering, and rising above problems, trials, and tribulations—which increases our ability to live with Deity eternally.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bio-card">
          <h3>If your life or writing were summarized in one sentence, what would it say?</h3>
          <p>This book will only help us if we are determined and serious about living with Deity in His heavenly mansions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bio-card">
          <h3>How do you want to engage with your readers?</h3>

          <h3>Do you have any hobbies or interests that influence your writing?</h3>
